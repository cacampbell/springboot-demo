Engage3 Interview Submission

A Simple Spring Boot App that uses Neo4J to represent a 'Category' hierarchy. 

I used Neo4J because it is a better choice than JPA for this particular thing and the API is extremely similar to Spring Boot JPA

You can run the app with an in memory database:

```
cd ./././app
gradle wrapper
./gradlew bootRun
```
